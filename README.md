# Pi-thonEyes
# Objectives
An understanding of the following concepts

- recursive methods
- type casting
- function declaration

# Description

The goal of this project is to use a user input decimal number and output the same value in binary, octal, and hex respectively. You are not allowed to the built in python methods hex(), oct(), or bin() to complete this task.

1/4 pts. The program compiles and is uploaded to GitHub via commandline

3/4 pts. The program accepts input and displays an equivalent output for binary, octal, and hex

# Hints, Tips, and Tricks

- Use recursive methods

- attach a comma at the end of print statements to avoid starting a new line
